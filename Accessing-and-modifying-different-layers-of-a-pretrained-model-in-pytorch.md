# Notes in pytorch to deal with ConvNets


## Accessing and modifying different layers of a pretrained model in pytorch

The goal is dealing with layers of a pretrained Model like resnet18 to print and frozen the parameters. Letâ€™s look at the content of resnet18 and shows the parameters. At first the layers are printed separately to see how we can access every layer seperately. 

```ruby

child_counter = 0
for child in model.children():
   print(" child", child_counter, "is:")
   print(child)
   child_counter += 1
```

The output of this piece of code is as follow:

```
child 0 is -
Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=(7, 7), stride=(2, 2), padding=(3, 3), bias=False)
child 1 is:
BatchNorm2d(64, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True)
child 2 is:
ReLU (inplace)
child 3 is:
MaxPool2d (size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), dilation=(1, 1))
child 4 is:
Sequential (
(0): BasicBlock ((conv1): Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1,1), bias=False)
(bn1): BatchNorm2d(64, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True)
(relu): ReLU (inplace)
(conv2): Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1,1), bias=False)
(bn2): BatchNorm2d(64, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True)
)
(1): BasicBlock ((conv1): Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1,1), bias=False)
(bn1): BatchNorm2d(64, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True)
(relu): ReLU (inplace)
(conv2): Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1,1), bias=False)
(bn2): BatchNorm2d(64, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True)
)
)
child 5 is:
Sequential (
(0): BasicBlock ((conv1): Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1,1),bias=False)
(bn1): BatchNorm2d(128, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True)
(relu): ReLU (inplace)
(conv2): Conv2d(128, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
(bn2): BatchNorm2d(128, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True)
(downsample): Sequential (
(0): Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=(1, 1), stride=(2, 2), bias=False)
(1): BatchNorm2d(128, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True)
)
)
(1): BasicBlock (
(conv1): Conv2d(128, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
(bn1): BatchNorm2d(128, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True)
(relu): ReLU (inplace)
(conv2): Conv2d(128, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
(bn2): BatchNorm2d(128, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True)
)
)
child 6 is: 
        others are not shown because of consuming less space
```

## Freezing parameters of some layers to prevent from retraining them

The following code prints parameters for layers in a pretrained model.

```ruby
for child in model.children():
   for param in child.parameters():
      print(param)
      break
   break
```

Several lines of output are shown as follow:

```
(0 ,0 ,.,.) =
1.8160e-02 2.1680e-02 5.6358e-02       
-02
2.6440e-02 1.0603e-02 1.9794e-02
-02
9.0205e-03 1.9536e-03 1.9925e-04
-03
...
-2.4830e-02 8.1022e-03 -4.9934e-02
-02
-2.3857e-02 -1.6275e-02 2.9058e-02
-03
-1.6848e-04 5.9266e-02 -5.8456e-03
-02
(0 ,1 ,.,.) =
-1.6319e-02 3.3193e-02 -2.2146e-04
```

Now, I consider to freeze the parameters of the first to the sixth layers as follow:

```ruby
child_counter = 0
for child in model.children():
   if child_counter < 6:
      print("child ",child_counter," was frozen")
      for param in child.parameters():
          param.requires_grad = False
   elif child_counter == 6:
      children_of_child_counter = 0
      for children_of_child in child.children():
         if children_of_child_counter < 1:
            for param in children_of_child.parameters():
	param.requires_grad = False
	print('child ', children_of_child_counter, 'of child',child
		_counter,' was frozen')
      else:
         print('child ', children_of_child_counter, 'of child',child
         _counter,' was not frozen')
         children_of_child_counter += 1
   else:
      print("child ",child_counter," was not frozen")
      child_counter += 1
   ```
The output of above code is as follow:   
   
   ```ruby
   child  0 was frozen
child  1 was frozen
child  2 was frozen
child  3 was frozen
child  4 was frozen
child  5 was frozen
child  0 of child 6 was frozen
child  1 of child 6 was not frozen
child  7 was not frozen
child  8 was not frozen
child  9 was not frozen
   ```
   
  ## Getting some layers
  
  In order to get some layers and remove the others, we can convert model.children() to a list and use indexing for specifying which layers we want. For this purpose in pytorch, it can be done as follow:

   ```ruby
     new_model = nn.Sequential(*list(model.children())[:-1])
   ```

The above line gets all layers except the last layer (it removes the last layer in model).

   ```ruby
   new_model_2_removed = nn.Sequential(*list(model.children())[:-2])
   ```

The above line removes the two last layers in resnet18 and get others.



## Adding new loss function 
To add a new loss function it is necessary to define a class that inherits from torch.nn.Module class. After  declaring initialization function, you just need to add forward function in order to compute loss and return it. In bottom it is shown.
```ruby
   class cust_loss(torch.nn.Module):
	    def __init__(self):
		super(cust_loss, self).__init__()

	    def forward(self, input, target):
		predicted_labels = torch.max(input, 1)[1].float()
		minus = predicted_labels - target.float()
		self.cust_distance = torch.sum(minus*minus).type(torch.FloatTensor)/predicted_labels.size()[0]
		return self.cust_distance
   ```
	
It is necessary note that all lines in forward function must return FloatTensor type in order to autograd can be computed in backward function. Finally you must use the declared loss function in your main function during training as follow.

   ```ruby
   ############ Withing main function ###########
    criterion = cust_loss()   #nn.CrossEntropyLoss()        
    Optimizer = optim.SGD(filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, model_conv.parameters()), lr=1e-3, momentum=0.9)
    ...
    if use_gpu:
       inputs = Variable(inputs.cuda(), requires_grad=True)
       labels = Variable(inputs.cuda(), requires_grad=True)
    else:
       inputs = Variable(inputs, requires_grad=True)
       labels = Variable(labels, requires_grad=True)
       
    loss = criterion(inputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
   ```

## Getting data from dataloader
It is considered to get data from dataloader without loop statement. There is a function that can do this for us. 

   ```ruby
   iter(train_target_loader).next()
   ```	

This statment returns a tensor with the size of 2\*batch_size*size_of_data. The first column is loaded data and the second column is corresponding labels for loaded data. Therefore, if we use the following statement, It returns data. It returns labels in case we change index to 1.

   ```ruby
   (iter(train_target_loader).next())[0]
   ```	 
 
 Now, consider we need to see image data in dataloader. At first, we must pay attention that data are loaded as PIL Image and converted to Tensor. When we need to get data from dataloader (data are loaded and converted to tensor), we must convert data back in dataloader to PIL Image. In this regard, consider the follow code:
 
   ```ruby
   for inputs,_ in train_loader:
       inputs = Variable(inputs)       
   ```	 

Now, data in inputs are tensor because they are loaded in dataloader as batch. It is necessary to write a transformation for converting back the data to PIL Image. For this purpose:

   ```ruby
    trans = transforms.ToPILImage()
    img_PIL = trans(inputs[0])
    img_PIL.show()    #### this line shows the first image in dataloader in a new windows
   ```	 


## Manipulating a pretrained model

Sometimes it is needed to extract some features from different layers of a pretrained model in a way that forward function can be run one time. In other words, running forward function in pretrained model and stopping it in a layer whose output is our interest is not a good method. Assume you wants to get output of several layers and you must run forward function several times (ie the number of runs is the number of layers whose output is our interest). To achieve this goal it is needed some background information.

Now consider the VGG16 architecture that is as follow (it is output of python)

	VGG (
	  (features): Sequential (
	    (0): Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (1): ReLU (inplace)
	    (2): Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (3): ReLU (inplace)
	    (4): MaxPool2d (size=(2, 2), stride=(2, 2), dilation=(1, 1))
	    (5): Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (6): ReLU (inplace)
	    (7): Conv2d(128, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (8): ReLU (inplace)
	    (9): MaxPool2d (size=(2, 2), stride=(2, 2), dilation=(1, 1))
	    (10): Conv2d(128, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (11): ReLU (inplace)
	    (12): Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (13): ReLU (inplace)
	    (14): Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (15): ReLU (inplace)
	    (16): MaxPool2d (size=(2, 2), stride=(2, 2), dilation=(1, 1))
	    (17): Conv2d(256, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (18): ReLU (inplace)
	    (19): Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (20): ReLU (inplace)
	    (21): Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (22): ReLU (inplace)
	    (23): MaxPool2d (size=(2, 2), stride=(2, 2), dilation=(1, 1))
	    (24): Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (25): ReLU (inplace)
	    (26): Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (27): ReLU (inplace)
	    (28): Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
	    (29): ReLU (inplace)
	    (30): MaxPool2d (size=(2, 2), stride=(2, 2), dilation=(1, 1))
	  )
	  (classifier): Sequential (
	    (0): Linear (25088 -> 4096)
	    (1): ReLU (inplace)
	    (2): Dropout (p = 0.5)
	    (3): Linear (4096 -> 4096)
	    (4): ReLU (inplace)
	    (5): Dropout (p = 0.5)
	    (6): Linear (4096 -> 1000)
	  )
	)	

To show you how to do this task, I use an example for illustration. Assume that I want to extract the first layers of VGG16 as features. In this regard, look at the following picture. The blue line shows which outputs I consider to get from layers.

![vgg-short](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15813546/32988686-5119820c-cd1e-11e7-8213-7a21a3227863.png)

As it can be seen from above picture and python output, our desire part of  vgg net is lines in the python output correspond with line from (0) to (15). Also, we need to concatenate output of lines (3), (8) and (15). The outputs of lines (8) and (15) must be enlarged (upsample) to obtain the size of the output in line (3); then they are concatenated to acheive the result. 

Now implementing a class for this purpose is as follow:
   ```ruby
   class myModel(nn.Module):
	    def __init__(self):
		super(myModel,self).__init__()
		vgg_model = torchvision.models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
		for child in vgg_model.children():
		    self.Conv1 = child[0]  # 3->64
		    self.Conv2 = child[2]  # 64->64
		    self.Conv3 = child[5]  # 64->128
		    self.Conv4 = child[7]  # 128->128
		    self.Conv5 = child[10]  # 128->256
		    self.Conv6 = child[12]  # 256->256
		    self.Conv7 = child[14]  # 256->256
		    self.upSample1 = nn.Upsample(scale_factor=2)
		    self.upSample2 = nn.Upsample(scale_factor=4)
		    break
	    def forward(self,x):
		out1 = self.Conv1(x)
		out1 = F.relu(out1)
		out1 = self.Conv2(out1)
		out1 = F.relu(out1)
		out1_mp = F.max_pool2d(out1, 2, 2)
		out2 = self.Conv3(out1_mp)
		out2 = F.relu(out2)
		out2 = self.Conv4(out2)
		out2 = F.relu(out2)
		out2_mp = F.max_pool2d(out2, 2, 2)
		out3 = self.Conv5(out2_mp)
		out3 = F.relu(out3)
		out3 = self.Conv6(out3)
		out3 = F.relu(out3)
		out3 = self.Conv7(out3)
		out3 = F.relu(out3)
		###### up sampling to create output with the same size
		out2 = self.upSample1(out2)
		out3 = self.upSample2(out3)
		#out7_mp = F.max_pool2d(out7, 2, 2)
		concat_features = torch.cat([out1, out2, out3], 1)
		return out1, concat_features
   ```
   
Also the above calss can be defined as follow:

   ```ruby
   class myModel(nn.Module):
	    def __init__(self):
		super(myModel,self).__init__()
		vgg_model = torchvision.models.vgg16(pretrained=True)		
		 self.Conv1 = nn.Sequential(*list(vgg_model.features.children())[0:4])
            self.Conv2 = nn.Sequential(*list(vgg_model.features.children())[4:9]) 
            self.Conv3 = nn.Sequential(*list(vgg_model.features.children())[9:16])
		 self.upSample1 = nn.Upsample(scale_factor=2)
		 self.upSample2 = nn.Upsample(scale_factor=4)
		    
	    def forward(self,x):
		out1 = self.Conv1(x)
      	out2 = self.Conv2(out1)
        	out3 = self.Conv3(out2)
		###### up sampling to create output with the same size
		out2 = self.upSample1(out2)
		out3 = self.upSample2(out3)
		concat_features = torch.cat([out1, out2, out3], 1)
		return out1, concat_features
   ```

I hope this piece of code can be helpful :-)


## obtaining different layers as group
There is not considerable difference with previous section. Here the other way of getting layers are shown.

 ```ruby
   class myModel(nn.Module):
	    def __init__(self):
		super(myModel,self).__init__()
		vgg_model = torchvision.models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
        	isFeatureMap_section = True
        	for child in vgg_model.children():
            if isFeatureMap_section:
                	self.Conv1 = nn.Sequential(*list(child)[0:4])
                	self.Conv2 = nn.Sequential(*list(child)[4:9]) 
                	self.Conv3 = nn.Sequential(*list(child)[9:16])
                	self.Conv4 = nn.Sequential(*list(child)[16:30])                
                	self.upSample1 = nn.Upsample(scale_factor=2)
                	self.upSample2 = nn.Upsample(scale_factor=4)
                	isFeatureMap_section = False
            else:
                self.L1 = nn.Sequential(*list(child)[0:7])
		    
	    def forward(self,x):
		out1 = self.Conv1(x)
      	out2 = self.Conv2(out1)
        	out3 = self.Conv3(out2)
		out4 = self.Conv4(out3)
		out5 = self.L1(out4)
		###### up sampling to create output with the same size
		out2 = self.upSample1(out2)
		out3 = self.upSample2(out3)
		concat_features = torch.cat([out1, out2, out3, out4], 1)
		return out5, concat_features
   ```
   


## Adding custom transformation
When we want to do a kind of preprocessing that is not implemented in pytorch library, it is axiomatic that preprocessing must be done on loaded images similar to torchvision.Transforms. But there is no function to do what we want. In this regard, we must implement our function in order to do preprocessing in a way that pytorch is going. So, I want to show you implementing a custom trasformation. (Wow, it is an easy job :-). So easy that it can be unbelievable)

At first, assume that our transformation is converting  BGR color space in loaded images to YUV color space. We want to implement a function that does this task similar to other torch transformations. For this purpose, a class is declared, pay attention to inheritance from object class, and a function whose name is __call__ is defined to convert color space as follow.

 ```ruby
 import cv2  # using opencv library in code for changing color space
   class myCustomTransform(object):
    def __call__(self, img):        
        image = np.array(img)
        yuv_img = cv2.cvtColor(image,cv2.COLOR_BGR2YUV)
	return  yuv_img
   ```
   After the definition of the class, we can use in source code with other torch transformations and change images to black images as follow.

 ```ruby
   data_transforms = {
        'train': transforms.Compose([            
            transforms.CenterCrop(224),
            myCustomTransform(),  #----------- using our custom transformation ------------> enjoy it ;-)
            transforms.ToTensor()
            #transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
        ]),
        'val': transforms.Compose([
            transforms.Scale(256),
            transforms.CenterCrop(224),
            transforms.ToTensor(),
            transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
            ]),
        }
	
    train_data_dir = 'xxxx/'
    val_data_dir   = 'xxxx/'
    train_set = datasets.ImageFolder(os.path.join(train_data_dir, 'train'), data_transforms['train']) #train    
    val_set   = datasets.ImageFolder(os.path.join(val_data_dir, 'val'), data_transforms['val'])
   ```
   
   
## A technical description for myself, which I will describe soon
------------------------------------ First Problem -----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above code transforms.Normalize is commented because when you debug your code, zero values in training images which are loaded as a batch will be unchanged. If the normalization is done, the zero values in image's pixels change.

Variable share the same memory as its underlying Tensor, so there is no memory savings by deleting it afterwards.
That being said, you can also replace the Tensor variable with a Variable containing the Tensor. E.g.,
 ```ruby

x = torch.rand(5)
x = Variable(x)
The only case where you might see some (small) savings is when you reach the end of the training loop, you might want to delete all references to the input tensor.

for i, (x, y) in enumerate(train_loader):
    x = Variable(x)
    y = Variable(y)
    # compute model and update
    del x, y, output 
 ```
    
This ensures that you wonâ€™t have double the memory necessary for x and y, because train_loader first allocates the memory, and then assign it to x.
But note that if your input tensor is relatively small, this saving by doing that is negligible and not worth it (you also need to make sure that all references to x are deleted, thatâ€™s why I del output as well).

------------------------------------Second Problem---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```ruby
class testNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(testNet, self).__init__()
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size=200, hidden_size=1000, num_layers=1)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(1000, 100)

    def forward(self, x, init):
        x = self.rnn(x, init)[0]
        y = self.linear(x.view(x.size(0)*x.size(1), x.size(2)))
        return y.view(x.size(0), x.size(1), y.size(1))

net = testNet()
init = Variable(torch.zeros(1, 4, 1000))
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)

total_loss = 0.0
for i in range(10000): #10000 mini-batch
    input = Variable(torch.randn(1000, 4, 200)) #Seqlen = 1000, batch_size = 4, feature = 200
    target = Variable(torch.LongTensor(4, 1000).zero_())

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = net(input, init)
    loss = criterion(output.view(-1, output.size(2)), target.view(-1))
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    total_loss += loss[0]

print(total_loss)
```
I expect memory usage not increasing per mini-batch. What might be the problem? (Correct me if my script is wrong)

## Answer

I think I see the problem. You have to remember that loss is a Variable, and indexing Variables, always returns a Variable, even if they're 1D! So when you do total_loss += loss[0] you're actually making total_loss a Variable, and adding more and more subgraphs to its history, making it impossible to free them, because you're still holding a reference. Just replace total_loss += loss[0] with total_loss += loss.data[0] and it should be back to normal.

## Live Updating with Matplotlib

Assume we have a generator network which has trained to generate images. In training phase, we want to see the networw k output to verify its improvement in generating the image every 500 epochs. In other words, our purpose is showing output image after each 500 epoch in a window using matplotlib library. In this regard, We must consider to update the figure window. The problem with matplot is that when the figure window is shown, as default it does not show the new image in eah 500 epoch in the same window; therefore, your screen is occupied with lots of figure windows. For this purpose, we write a method/function and call it in a training loop in order to show images in one figure window so that the current window is updated by new generated image in the network. The function is as follow:

```ruby

def plot_image(image):        
    ax1.clear()  
    plt.imshow(image)
    plt.draw()
    plt.pause(.02)    
```

So easy, right? :-)
