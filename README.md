# CHnet
A MKSnet based deep learning approach for learning from and accellerating cahn-hilliard simulations.


# Notes:
* identify inflection points in microstructure transformation in PC space.
* train one model for each transition point - perhaps with variable model sizes as needed.
* study how differnetial operators can be approximated in discreete spacedd.
